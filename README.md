# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Serking**, a software developer focusing on front-end web technologies.

I hate tedious, repetitive tasks. :smiley:

I earned my bachelor's degree in Information Technology at the University of Perpetual Help System Laguna with an academic honor of distinction: *Magna Cum Laude*.

I spend most of my free time reading books, listening to music, playing video games or watching movies, TV series or anime.

If time permits, I also hang out with my friends and family.
